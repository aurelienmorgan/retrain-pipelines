This Space serves as an API endpoint to render repo-hosted `pipeline-card` items. It complements model-versions trained with the <code><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aurelienmorgan/retrain-pipelines">retrain-pipelines</a></code> library, which publishes them on the Hub!

In essence, it serves the same purpose as <a target="_blank" href="https://html-preview.github.io/">html-preview.github.io</a> does for GitHub-hosted html files, but for HF-Hub hosted ones&nbsp;!

So, basically, it handles authentication and renders raw repo html files into your web-browser.

<Tip>

If you want to use it for model repositories that are <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated">gated</a> or private to you and published via the `retrain-pipelines` librairy, just duplicate it and assigne the `HF_TOKEN`secret with a proper value. Simple as that&nbsp;!
